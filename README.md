## Experience with the project 
### Tell us about your process
I ended up changing certain layout choices on the tablet and desktop layouts for the programs & services page as well as the community page, becuase the layout seemed to better suit the project than the original intented.  
The additions of the icons in the membership section of the program & services page was a stylistic choice that was not previously added to the mockups, but I thought would add to the overall simplistic design of the website. 
I started off the project by uploading and organizing all the necessary files. 
Once I built that, I used comments to build a rough structure to determine what i needed to code.  
After that I built piece of the page, making sure there was consistency in the areas that needed to be identical, like the header/nav and the footer.

### Challenges and how I overcame them
I had some difficulty with using flex and grid during this project, but overcame the issues by asking my significant other for help and also resorted to ChatGPT for any questions he couldn't answer.
In my design, I wanted to include a calendar, not realizing that a dynamic calendar would mean javascript. I tried to include the use of one of the date and time libraries in the IMDAC but I wasn't able to figure out how to connect it to my html file. So instead, I created a public calendar on Google Calendar and embedded that into the html, imputting the classes from each of the different facilities. 

### What have I learned
I need to better manage my time with coding, as I feel I could've probably done a better job with some of the states of the buttons and such.   
I might need some extra practice in grid and flexbox... 

Bootstrap is a very useful tool and Emmet shorthand saves a lot of time.
Applying the different states to the buttons at the very end was probably not the best idea, once I had all the pages built, it was a bit more difficult to find the spots where I needed to add the classes. 

Building one page at a time could've possibly been a better option than to tackle all 4 pages at the same time, but I dont necessarily regret working on all of them at the same time.
